This is the Solution to the The coding challenge for MachEight Entry Level

## Quick Start

The project was made in python using The Python Standard Library.

To open the project run Main.py and use the console
The Main_test.py file contains unit test made to the program using unittest

## Project

The project is to write a function that searches through NBA player heights
based on user input. The raw data is taken from
[here](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=nba_heights).  The data is
served in json format by the endpoint
[here](https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com/).

The task is to create an application that takes a single integer input. The
application will download the raw data from the website above
(https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com) and print a list of all pairs of players
whose height in inches adds up to the integer input to the application. If no
matches are found, the application will print "No matches found"

The algorithm to find the pairs must be faster than O(n^2). All edge cases
should be handled appropriately. This is _not_ a closed book test. You are
encouraged to reach out with any questions that you come across.
